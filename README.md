# VibeMUSE - Modern Multi-User Shared Environment

**VibeMUSE** is a modernization project that transforms the classic TinyMUSE server into a contemporary web-based platform with modern architecture, RESTful APIs, and real-time capabilities. This project preserves all original functionality while enabling modern web and mobile clients through a carefully structured technology stack.

## About VibeMUSE

VibeMUSE stands on the shoulders of the original TinyMUSE project, modernizing its rich feature set for today's web. The project follows a comprehensive 32-week development plan across 7 phases, transforming a 1990s C codebase into a modern web architecture while maintaining complete feature parity.

### Key Features
- **Modern Architecture**: RESTful API with React/TypeScript frontend
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for instant updates  
- **Database Modernization**: PostgreSQL with Supabase for scalability
- **Preserved Functionality**: All 200+ original TinyMUSE features maintained
- **Mobile Ready**: Modern responsive design for all devices

### Target Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with real-time capabilities
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with modern UI/UX
- **Authentication**: JWT + session-based hybrid approach
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live communication

## Original TinyMUSE Attribution

VibeMUSE is built upon the foundation of TinyMUSE, created after the MUD codebase explosion of 1990 and based on version 1.5 of TinyMUSH. We honor and acknowledge the original work and contributors who made this project possible.

### Original TinyMUSE History

TinyMUSE was based on TinyMUD and had a fairly short lifespan, being quickly surpassed by its contemporaries. Though updated occasionally, it was largely a dead project with a small server population. The original v1.9f3 code was outdated and difficult to compile and run.

The original TinyMUSE repository was created by [Belisarius Smith](https://www.belisariussmith.com/ "Belisarius Smith") for preservation and posterity, providing a compilable and working version with minor cleanup and improvements to meet modern C standards.
