### Progress Tracking Dashboard
```typescript
// Progress tracking interface
interface ProjectProgress {
  phase: string;
  week: number;
  totalWeeks: number;
  completedTasks: number;
  totalTasks: number;
  milestones: Milestone[];
  risks: Risk[];
  metrics: SuccessMetric[];
}

interface Milestone {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phase: string;
  targetDate: Date;
  completedDate?: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'delayed';
  dependencies: string[];
  deliverables: string[];
}

interface Risk {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  probability: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  mitigation: string;
  status: 'open' | 'mitigated' | 'accepted';
}

interface SuccessMetric {
  name: string;
  target: number;
  current: number;
  unit: string;
  trend: 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining';
}
```

### Automated Progress Reporting
```typescript
// Progress report generator
class ProgressReporter {
  async generateWeeklyReport(): Promise<ProgressReport> {
    const progress = await this.calculateProgress();
    const milestones = await this.getMilestoneStatus();
    const risks = await this.getRiskAssessment();
    const metrics = await this.getSuccessMetrics();
    
    return {
      reportDate: new Date(),
      overallProgress: progress,
      milestones,
      risks,
      metrics,
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(progress, risks)
    };
  }
  
  async calculateProgress(): Promise<ProgressSummary> {
    const phases = await this.getAllPhases();
    const totalTasks = phases.reduce((sum, phase) => sum + phase.totalTasks, 0);
    const completedTasks = phases.reduce((sum, phase) => sum + phase.completedTasks, 0);
    
    return {
      overallPercentage: (completedTasks / totalTasks) * 100,
      currentPhase: this.getCurrentPhase(),
      onTrack: this.isOnTrack(),
      estimatedCompletion: this.getEstimatedCompletion()
    };
  }
}
```

### Risk Management
```markdown
# Risk Register

## High Priority Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| Data Migration Complexity | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing and backup procedures | Open |
| Real-time Performance | High | Medium | Load testing and optimization strategies | Open |
| Feature Parity | High | Low | Comprehensive feature mapping and UAT | Open |

## Medium Priority Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| Technology Stack Learning Curve | Medium | Medium | Phased approach and team training | Open |
| Timeline Delays | Medium | Medium | Buffer time and parallel development | Open |
| Resource Availability | Medium | Low | Cross-training and documentation | Open |
```

### Success Metrics
```typescript
// Success metrics tracking
const successMetrics: SuccessMetric[] = [
  {
    name: 'API Response Time',
    target: 200,
    current: 0,
    unit: 'ms',
    trend: 'stable'
  },
  {
    name: 'Real-time Message Delivery',
    target: 100,
    current: 0,
    unit: 'ms',
    trend: 'stable'
  },
  {
    name: 'System Uptime',
    target: 99.9,
    current: 0,
    unit: '%',
    trend: 'stable'
  },
  {
    name: 'Feature Parity',
    target: 100,
    current: 0,
    unit: '%',
    trend: 'improving'
  },
  {
    name: 'Code Coverage',
    target: 90,
    current: 0,
    unit: '%',
    trend: 'improving'
  }
];
