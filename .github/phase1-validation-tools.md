## Overview
Create comprehensive data validation and integrity checking tools to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data throughout the migration and ongoing operations.

## User Story
As a **database administrator**, I need robust validation tools that can verify data integrity before, during, and after migration, so that I can be confident that no data is lost or corrupted in the modernization process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pre-migration validation tools created
- [ ] Post-migration validation tools created
- [ ] Ongoing data integrity monitoring implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive test data fixtures created
- [ ] Automated validation reports generated
- [ ] Data inconsistency detection and reporting
- [ ] Performance validation tools created
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks completed

## Technical Details

### Validation Components
1. **Pre-migration Validation**
   - Source data integrity checks
   - Schema compatibility validation
   - Dependency relationship verification
   - Data quality assessment

2. **Migration Validation**
   - Real-time migration monitoring
   - Data transformation verification
   - Relationship mapping validation
   - Progress tracking and reporting

3. **Post-migration Validation**
   - Data completeness verification
   - Relationship integrity checks
   - Performance validation
   - Feature parity validation

## Implementation Structure

├── pre_migration.py    # Pre-migration checks
├── migration.py        # Migration monitoring
├── post_migration.py   # Post-migration validation

```

### Key Validation Tools
```python
class DataValidator:
    def __init__(self, source_db, target_db):
        self.source = source_db
        self.target = target_db
    
    def validate_data_integrity(self):
        """Check data integrity constraints"""
        pass
    
    def validate_relationships(self):
        """Verify foreign key relationships"""
        pass
    
    def validate_completeness(self):
        """Ensure no data loss"""
        pass
    
    def validate_performance(self):
        """Check query performance"""
        pass
    
    def generate_report(self):
        """Generate validation report"""
        pass
```

## Validation Scenarios

### Data Integrity Checks
- [ ] **User Data Validation**
  - Username uniqueness
  - Email format validation
  - Password hash integrity
  - User class constraints
  - Power assignment validity

- [ ] **Object Data Validation**
  - Object type constraints
  - Ownership relationships
  - Location references
  - Attribute format validation
  - Circular reference detection

- [ ] **Relationship Validation**
  - Parent-child relationships
  - User-object ownership
  - Room-exit connections
  - Message threading integrity
  - Session data consistency

### Performance Validation
- [ ] **Query Performance**
  - Index effectiveness
  - Query execution times
  - Connection pool performance
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Concurrent access testing

- [ ] **Database Performance**
  - Table scan efficiency
  - Join operation performance
  - Backup and recovery times
  - Real-time subscription performance
  - Storage utilization

## Test Data Fixtures
```python
# Test data generation
class TestDataGenerator:
    def generate_users(self, count=1000):
        """Generate test users with various classes"""
        pass
    
    def generate_objects(self, count=5000):
        """Generate test objects with relationships"""
        pass
    
    def generate_messages(self, count=10000):
        """Generate test communication data"""
        pass
    
    def generate_complex_world(self):
        """Generate complex interconnected game world"""
        pass
```

## Validation Reports
```python
# Validation report structure
class ValidationReport:
    def __init__(self):
        self.errors = []
        self.warnings = []
        self.stats = {}
        self.performance_metrics = {}
    
    def add_error(self, message, data=None):
        """Add validation error"""
        pass
    
    def add_warning(self, message, data=None):
        """Add validation warning"""
        pass
    
    def generate_summary(self):
        """Generate validation summary"""
        pass
    
    def export_to_json(self):
        """Export report to JSON"""
        pass
```
