## Overview
Set up and configure the Supabase project as the primary database and backend-as-a-service platform for VibeMUSE.

## User Story
As a **developer**, I need a properly configured Supabase project with real-time capabilities, authentication, and database management, so that I can build the VibeMUSE APIs on a solid cloud infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Supabase project created and configured
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions configured
- [ ] Authentication settings configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures established
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets configured
- [ ] Development and production environments set up

## Technical Details

### Supabase Configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ 
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with custom claims
- **Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions for live updates
- **Storage**: File storage for any future media needs
- **Edge Functions**: For complex server-side logic

### Required Setup Tasks
1. **Project Creation**
   - Create Supabase project
   - Configure organization and project settings
   - Set up billing and resource limits

2. **Database Setup**
   - Configure database parameters
   - Enable necessary extensions (UUID, etc.)
   - Set up connection pooling
   - Configure backup schedules

3. **Authentication**
   - Configure JWT settings
   - Set up custom authentication providers if needed
   - Configure password policies
   - Set up user roles and permissions

4. **Real-time Configuration**
   - Enable real-time for required tables
   - Configure real-time security policies
   - Set up WebSocket connection limits

## Configuration Steps
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g @supabase/cli

# Initialize project
supabase init

# Start local development
supabase start

# Apply migrations
supabase db push

# Configure environment variables
supabase secrets set --env-file .env
```

## Environment Variables
```env
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres

# Application Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Supabase project created and accessible
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] All required extensions enabled
- [ ] RLS policies configured
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions working
- [ ] Authentication flows configured
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Development environment functional
- [ ] Production environment ready

## Dependencies
- Development environment setup
- Team access permissions configured

## Estimated Effort
**1 week** (Week 1 of Phase 1)

## Security Considerations
- [ ] API keys properly secured
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Database credentials encrypted
- [ ] Production environment isolated
- [ ] Backup data encrypted

## Notes
- This is a prerequisite for all database-related development
- Proper security configuration is critical from the start
- Consider multi-environment setup (dev/staging/prod)
- Document all configuration decisions for team reference
