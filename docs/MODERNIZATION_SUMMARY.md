- Resource requirements and success metrics
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Parallel development opportunities

### 2. [Modernization Architecture](MODERNIZATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Purpose**: Technical architecture and design specifications
**Key Contents**:
- Detailed architecture comparison (current vs. target)
- Database schema design with full SQL implementation
- API design patterns and WebSocket architecture
- Security implementation with JWT and session management
- Performance optimization and monitoring strategies

### 3. [Implementation Guide](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
**Purpose**: Practical implementation steps and code examples
**Key Contents**:
- Week-by-week implementation checklist
- Complete code examples for API endpoints
- Database migration scripts and tools
- Environment setup and configuration
- Development workflow and commands

## Key Modernization Decisions

### Technology Stack Selection
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript (aligns with React frontend)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (Lovable project compatibility)
