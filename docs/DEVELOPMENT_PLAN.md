# VibeMUSE Development Plan: Modernization Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for modernizing the TinyMUSE server (a 1990s C program) into a modern web architecture with RESTful APIs. The plan preserves all existing functionality while enabling modern web and mobile clients through a carefully structured technology stack progression.

## Project Overview

### Current State
- **Codebase**: ~29,000 lines of well-documented C code
- **Architecture**: Single-process server with TCP/IP connections
- **Database**: Custom text-based format with 4 object types
- **Features**: 200+ comprehensive features across all game mechanics
- **Protocol**: Telnet-compatible text-based interface

### Target Architecture
- **Backend**: RESTful API with modern authentication and real-time capabilities
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with proper relational design
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript (Lovable project) with modern UI/UX
- **Supporting**: Python scripts for administrative and utility functions
- **Integration**: WebSocket for real-time communication

### Core Principles
1. **Preserve all existing functionality** - No feature loss during modernization
2. **Incremental migration** - Minimize risk through phased approach
3. **Modern standards** - Use contemporary security, performance, and UX practices
4. **Maintainable architecture** - Clean separation of concerns and scalable design

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Backend Framework Selection
**Recommended: Node.js with Express/Fastify**
- **Rationale**: JavaScript ecosystem aligns with React frontend
- **Benefits**: Shared language, extensive ecosystem, excellent WebSocket support
- **Considerations**: TypeScript for type safety, matches frontend stack
- **Alternative**: Python with FastAPI (more familiar for Python scripting integration)

### Database Design
**Primary: Supabase (PostgreSQL)**
- **Rationale**: Modern SQL database with real-time capabilities
- **Benefits**: Built-in auth, real-time subscriptions, REST API generation
- **Migration Strategy**: Map TinyMUSE object system to relational schema
- **Real-time**: Leverage Supabase real-time for instant updates

### Authentication & Authorization
**JWT + Session-based hybrid approach**
- **JWT**: For stateless API access and mobile clients
- **Sessions**: For web client persistence and admin interfaces
- **Integration**: Supabase Auth for user management
- **Migration**: Preserve existing user classes and powers system

### Real-time Communication
**WebSockets + Server-Sent Events**
- **WebSockets**: For bidirectional real-time communication (say, poses, movement)
- **SSE**: For server-to-client updates (announcements, notifications)
- **Integration**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for data consistency

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for modernizing TinyMUSE into a fully functional REST API-based system. The phased approach minimizes risk while ensuring all original functionality is preserved and enhanced with modern capabilities.

The 32-week timeline allows for thorough development, testing, and polish while maintaining a sustainable pace. The technology stack selection (Node.js, Supabase, React/TypeScript) provides a modern, maintainable foundation that aligns with current web development best practices.

Success depends on careful attention to data migration, comprehensive testing, and maintaining feature parity with the original system. The resulting modernized VibeMUSE will provide a solid foundation for future enhancements and continued evolution of the platform.
